## 1. Problem Statement
<p align="justify">
Language modeling is the task of predicting the next word in a sequence of text, given the previous words. It is a fundamental problem in natural language processing (NLP) with a wide range of applications. 
  Effective language models can be used to power intelligent assistants, improve machine translation, generate realistic text, enhance speech recognition, and even assist with code completion. 
  These models learn patterns in language by training on large text corpora, allowing them to capture the complexities of human communication. 
  Advancements in language modeling have been a driving force behind the recent progress in various NLP tasks, making it a crucial component in developing more natural and intelligent interactions
  between humans and machines.
